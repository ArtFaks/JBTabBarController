{"name":"JBTabBarController","body":"**JBTabBarController** aims to be a drop-in replacement of `UITabBarController`, but with the intention of letting developers easily customise its appearance. **JBTabBar** uses images for all UI elements except for the labels on TabBar items. This gives the Developer/Designer the freedom to customise all aspects of the TabBar. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the images for selected and unselected states can be specified and are colour images not clipping masks. `UITabBarItem+JBAdditions.h` adds an additional property (`selectedImage`) to `UITabBarItem` which specifies the image to show in the selected state.\r\n\r\n### Installation Notes\r\nTo use, import all the files in the **JBTabBarController** folder into your project and include \"`JBTabBarController.h`\" where ever it is needed or in your precompiled header. \r\n\r\nAlso, include \"`JBTabBarController+ConvenienceMethods.h`\" if you want to use the convenience property added to `UIViewController`. This property works the same as the `tabBarController` property on `UIViewController` and gives you access to the relevant **JBTabBarController** from any of the `UIViewController`s contained in it.\r\n\r\nThe project uses ARC and targets iOS 4.0+ devices.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJin Budelmann - @jinthagerman","tagline":"Aims to be a configurable drop-in replacement of UITabBarController","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
